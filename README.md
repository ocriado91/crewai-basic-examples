In this example, we implement a basic Multi-Agent system to generate a blog post
about any topic given by the user. The system consists of three specialized AI agents
working together:

### 1. Content Planner Agent

Agent in charge of research the topic and creates a comprehensive content plan

### 2. Content Writer Agent
Creates the actual article based on the planner's outline.

### 3. Editor Agent
Reviews and refines the final content.
